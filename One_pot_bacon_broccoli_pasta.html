    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 strips of bacon, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 cups dry rigatoni pasta, (or other small shape like penne)</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>

        <li>2 cups broccoli florets</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, (more for sprinkling on top) </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large saucepan, pot or Dutch oven, cook the bacon until crispy. Remove bacon from pan and drain on paper
            towels. Drain fat from the pot leaving about 1 tablespoon in the pot.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic and sautee for about 30 seconds. Add the uncooked pasta, cream, chicken broth, salt (and pepper),
            and crushed red pepper. Stir. Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer. Cover and cook for about 6 minutes making
            sure to stir once in a while and keep noodles covered in liquid.</li>
        <li>Add the broccoli to the pot and cook another 5-7 minutes or until the broccoli is soft. Continue cooking until
            sauce is a little thicker. It will be thin and then thicken towards the end. Stir in the Parmesan and reserved
            bacon.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately and top with additional Parmesan.</li>
    </ol>
