    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 lb pork roast (can sub pork shoulder, butt or tenderloin here too)</li>
        <li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp freshly cracked back pepper</li>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion, diced small</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground cumin (optional)</li>
        <li>1 [16-ounce] jar of hatch green chiles (I use Medium spicy)</li>
        <li>1 lb Yuk on gold potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
        <li>2 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut pork into 1/2-inch cubes and season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Turn the Instant Pot on to the 'saute' function and add the olive oil. When the oil starts to shimmer and
            the pot is hot, add the pork and brown on all sides, about 2 minutes per side. (You might need to do this in
            two batches to prevent overcrowding.) Set browned pork on aside on a clean plate.</li>
        <li>With the Instant Pot still on the saute function, add your onions, garlic and cumin. Cook until onions begin
            to soften, about 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>When the onions are softened, hit the 'cancel/keep warm' button on the Instant Pot. Add the browned pork
            back into the pot along with the cumin, jar of green chiles, potatoes, chicken broth and bay leaf. Stir to
            combine.</li>
        <li>Secure the lid on your Instant Pot and make sure that the valve on the top is facing towards 'sealed'. Press
            the 'Meat/Stew' button and set the time to 35 minutes. Walk away from the InstantPot and let it do it's
            thing. When the cook time is complete, carefully release the pressure in the InstantPot by turning the valve
            to 'vent'. Once all the pressure is released and there is no more steam coming out of the InstantPot,
            carefully open the lid.</li>
        <li>You can either serve as is, or garnish as desired! Cilantro leaves, shredded cabbage and diced avocado all
            goes well on top of the soup-- but only if you have it around Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
